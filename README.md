# ⚽ Portland Hearts of Pine: Player Substitution Simulator
**Predictive Performance Optimization via Base44 Logic**

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project applies predictive analytics to professional soccer (USL League One) to solve a critical coaching challenge: **When is the optimal time to sub a starter?** Using historical performance data from the Portland Hearts of Pine, I built a simulator that predicts the "Performance Decay Point" for individual players.

## 📊 How it Works
The simulator uses **Base44** logic to process real-time and historical player metrics. By analyzing variables such as:
* **Minutes Played:** Tracking the physical "red line."
* **Positional Intensity:** Accounting for the higher fatigue rates of midfielders vs. defenders.
* **Historical Fatigue Curves:** Using last year's stats to predict when a player's efficiency drops below a 70% threshold.

## 🛠️ The Technology: Why Base44?
While complex machine learning models are great for post-match analysis, I utilized **Base44** for this simulator to prioritize **speed and portability**. 
* **Side-line Ready:** The logic is lightweight enough to run on low-latency devices.
* **Modular:** The engine can be easily adjusted mid-match to account for high-intensity scenarios (e.g., playing a man down).

## 🌌 Galaxy-Wide Application
This project serves as a "Proof of Concept" for the **Go Forth Galaxy**. It demonstrates that the same predictive principles used in **Senior Living Lead Propensity** can be translated to:
* **Go-Forth Home Services:** Optimizing technician routing based on job-completion "decay."
* **Core Coffee:** Predicting staff "substitution" needs during peak morning rushes.
